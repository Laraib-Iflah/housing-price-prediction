# housing-price prediction

Data visualization and analysis on 35 years of data on macroeconomic factors affecting housing prices in the US.
We predict housing prices using a deep neural network with Dense layers that gives an accuracy of 96%.

The dataset is provided in the repository.

You can simply download the notebook and check it out for yourself. My kaggle profile is linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/laraibishere Follow along to see my ongoing work :)

    # key lessons
    In this project, we learn the following:
    -> Macroeconomic factors that influence housing prices 
    -> Data visualization using heatmaps
    -> Exploring correlation between features 
    -> Building a deep neural network for predicting outcome
    -> Plotting the neural network model for explanability

    # key skills
    -> Analyzing complex numerical data with correlated features 
    -> Using heatmaps to visualize data
    -> Building and implementing a deep neural network model
    -> Model validation
    -> Making predictions with up to 96% accuracy

    # ML algorithm used
    Keral sequential model with Dense layers using ReLU activation.
